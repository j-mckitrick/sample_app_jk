      Have a proposal that fits? Great! Provide us with the basic details of your project and start gaining followers immediately. Once you gain enough followers we’ll invite you to apply for financing. The amount of followers you need is determined by the size of your project--we’ll provide you with the tools to leverage your existing network in addition to ours! Even if your proposal doesn’t fit today, it might in the near future. We’re planning to expand in early 2014. If your timeline to close funds is flexible, go ahead and propose your project now -- and we’ll let you know when it’s time to apply.
